# Problems for the practice

## These are the problems where you can get the idea what to code today. Below are the problems, pick anyone and submit it as the code for today.

## **Problems:**

### 1. Take two 2D arrays and return single 2D array by making a Matrix multiplication of both the arrays.
### 2. Implement a Queue and also implement all the basic properties of Queue by using Array.
### 3. Implement a Stack and also implement all the basic properties of Stack by using Array.
### 4. Implement a Stack by using Array and then implement Queue by using Stack.
### 5. Take an "iNPut SENtenCe" and retrun an "Output Sentence" in Camle Case as result.
### 6. Take a string ranString = "aaa bbhh nn kkkkkdfgsjhs kdhgsjrjs kkhsd" or something similar. Take your name as input and return true if your name can be built with the characters available in ranString, else return false.
### 7. Here are different country codes for mobile numbers like +91(in) +1(us) +92(pak) +65(sin) +852(hong). You have an array having the numbers of various countries above. You need to make separate arrays of separate countries.
